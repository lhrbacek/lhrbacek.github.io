# Heartbeat of Brno

Brno's tram network represents the blood vessels of the entire city.
The beating centre supplies energy to the trams, representing the red blood cells, delivering oxygen to the whole body.
Stop for a moment and see how the trams gradually portray the circulatory system of the city.

This visualization uses the API from Brno's website and shows the current location of the trams in real time.
